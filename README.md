# Bob

> Check out [Stuart SSG](https://github.com/augustofrade/stuart-ssg), Bob's companion!

Bob is your CLI buddy aimed to help you with your needs. Bob can remember and execute custom actions as well as do some of them on the fly through commands.

Content passed to actions to be learnt can be passed through stdin or as positional parameters.

Bob was made to be quick and easy to use, as well as a familiar and a relaxed experience.
That's why I named it Bob and didn't follow a standardized command naming approach, such as `bob <command> <subcommand>` (e.g.: `bob actions add`),
for its core commands, and used common day-to-day english verbs instead, namely `forget` and `do`. In the end, it feels as if the user is asking a friend to do something to help them: `bob do open_teddies_folder`.

Bob can do much more, check the Features section below!

## Example Usage

In the following example Bob learns and executes an action:

```bash
$ bob learn say_hi "Hello, Bob!"
$ bob do say_hi # or just bob say_hi

Hello, Bob!
```

## 📚 Commands

### 🎓 Learn Command

Teach Bob something new to remember and execute another time.

```bash
bob learn <action_name> <content> [options]
```

**Options:**

- `--type <type>`: Type of content (default: "text")
  - `text`: Plain text content
  - `file`: File path\*
  - `dir`: Directory path\*
  - `list-dir`: Directory listing\*
  - `script`: Executable script\*
  - `qr`: content that will be encoded to QR Code
  - `template`: file that is saved in Bob's data and copied as a template later with `bob do <action>`,
  - `secret`: secret that will be encrypted on save and decrypted later with `bob do <action>`,
- `--force, -f`: Tells bob to update its knowledge of the provided action

\* Relative paths will be converted to absolute paths.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Learn a simple text action
bob learn say_hello "Hello, World!"

# Learn a path. Example result path: `/home/\<user\>/Documents/teddies
bob learn teddies_folder ./teddies

# Learn a script
bob learn ruby_script main.rb --type script

# Learn a template of a CSS file and use it later with or without a name/path
bob learn css_template style.css --type template
cd ~/website/styles
bob do css_template # same as source file = style.css
bob do css_template ~/portfolio/styles/main.css # another directory with another name

```

### 🎯 Do Command

Explicitly execute a previously learnt action.

**Note**: For script actions, Bob will try to call the runtime of the file first by its shebang
and then by the command/file set in the PATH of the user's system.

```bash
bob do <action_name>
```

**Note**: An action named "qr" will work with `bob do qr`, as it explictly executes an action, whilst it won't with `bob qr` as `qr` is a standard command.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Execute the provided "say_hello" action
bob do say_hello

# Provide no action name to list all learnt actions
bob do

## Run previously learnt Ruby script action
bob do ruby_script

## Use previously learnt template
cd ~/website/src/components
bob do react_card card.jsx
```

### 🗑️ Forget Command

Remove a previously learnt action from Bob's memory.

```bash
bob forget <action_name>
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Forget the "say_hello" action
bob forget say_hello
```

### 🧹 Clear Command

Clear Bob's entire memory, removing all learnt actions.

```bash
bob clear
```

### 🔑 Passwd Commands

Commands related to the master password management for actions of type "secret".

- `bob passwd set <password>`: Sets the master password to be used during the encryption and decryption of "secret" actions.
- `bob passwd forget`: Clears the saved master password. Use `--confirm` to confirm that it should be cleared.
- `bob passwd status`: Displays whether a master password is set or not.

The master password is saved through the credential manager of the user's OS. Bob has access only to its own credential service scope.

### 🌐 Serve Command

Start a local HTTP server and serve the contents of the specified directory.

When the server starts, it automatically opens a browser tab with the server URL.

```bash
bob serve [directory] [options]
```

**Options:**

- `--port, -p <number>`: Port to run the server on (default: 3000)
- `--watch, -w`: Watch the directory Bob is serving for hot reloading (default: true)
- `--open, -o`: Opens the served directory in the default web browser (default: true)
- `--log-level, -l <level>`: Sets the log level for server output (choices: "info", "debug", "verbose", default: "info")

**Examples:**

```bash
# Serve the current directory on default port (3000) in watch mode
bob serve

# Serve a specific directory on custom port without watching the directory contents
bob serve ~/Documents/portfolio -p 8080 --watch false
```

**Logging Output Example:**

```bash
$ bob serve --log-level "debug"

Serving directory /home/user/Documents/portfolio/
Server is running at http://localhost:3000

[INFO]     Incoming request URL: /
[DEBUG]    Resolved file path: /home/user/Documents/portfolio/index.html

[INFO]     Incoming request URL: /styles.css
[DEBUG]    Resolved file path: /home/user/Documents/portfolio/styles.css

[INFO]     Incoming request URL: /assets/dog.jpg
[DEBUG]    Resolved file path: /home/user/Documents/portfolio/assets/dog.jpg
```

### 💽 Minify Command

Minify `*.css` files into their `*.min.css` counterparts or bundle them all together into a single file.

Multiple file and directory paths can be passed to the minification process and will be processed **in the order they are passed**.
If your CSS has to be loaded from the client in a specific order, consider passing the path to each file of the source directory in the desired order.

If no output is specified, the minified content will be saved in the current working directory.

```bash
bob minify [files...] [options]
```

**Options:**

- `--output, -o <string>`: Output directory of the minified files; if `--singlefile` used, it is the output **file**.
- `--singlefile, -o`: Bundles all minified content into a single file. The default output file is `styles.min.css` if `--output`is not used.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Minifies all files of the current directory. Output in the same directory
bob minify

# Minifies all files of the passed directory. Output in the current directory
bob minify styles

# Minifies all files into an output directory
bob minify styles -o dist

# Minifies multiple files from different directories into a single file
bob minify styles dir1/style1.css dir2/style2.css --output site.min.css --singlefile
```

**Input and output:**

```css

/* INPUT */
body {
  user-drag: none;
  /*

  first comment

  */
  user-select: none;
  /*
  -moz-user-select: none;
  -webkit-user-drag: none;
  -webkit-user-select: none;
  -ms-user-select: none;
  margin: 0;
*/
}

#container {
  width: 100vw;
  ...
}

/* OUTPUT */
body{user-drag:none;user-select:none}#container{width:100vw;...}

```

### 🌳 Tree Command

Display a tree structure of the specified directory with customizable depth and formatting.

```bash
bob tree [directory] [options]
```

**Options:**

- `--depth, -d <number>`: Depth of the tree structure to display (default: 3)
- `--identation-size, -i <number>`: Size in spaces of the displayed indentation (default: 2)
- `--identation-char, -c <char>`: Character used to display the indentation (default: "-")
- `--show-hidden, -h`: Show hidden files and directories
- `--show-files, -f`: Show files in the tree structure (default: true)
- `--full-path, -p`: Show full path of files and directories. With this flag, Bob ignore the indentation size and character options.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Display tree of current directory with default options
bob tree

# Display directory tree structure
# - without an indentation character,
# - indentation of 4 spaces
# - showing hidden files
bob tree ./project -h -i 4 -c " "
