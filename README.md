# Bob

> Check out [Stuart SSG](https://github.com/augustofrade/stuart-ssg), Bob's companion!

Bob is your CLI buddy aimed to help you with your needs. Bob can remember and execute custom actions as well as do some of them on the fly through commands.

Content passed to actions to be learnt can be passed through stdin or as positional parameters.

Bob was made to be quick and easy to use, as well as a familiar and a relaxed experience.
That's why I named it Bob and didn't follow a standardized command naming approach, such as `bob <command> <subcommand>` (e.g.: `bob actions add`),
for its core commands, and used common day-to-day english verbs instead, namely `forget` and `do`. In the end, it feels as if the user is asking a friend to do something to help them: `bob do open_teddies_folder`.

Bob can do much more, check the Features section below!

## üìö Commands

### üéì Learn Command

bob learn teddies_folder ./teddies
```

### üéØ Do Command

Execute a previously learnt action.

```

### üíΩ Minify Command

Minify `*.css` files into their `*.min.css` counterparts or bundle them all together into a single file.

Multiple file and directory paths can be passed to the minification process and will be processed **in the order they are passed**.
If your CSS has to be loaded from the client in a specific order, consider passing the path to each file of the source directory in the desired order.

If no output is specified, the minified content will be saved in the current working directory.

```bash
bob minify [files...] [options]
```

**Options:**

- `--output, -o <string>`: Output directory of the minified files; if `--singlefile` used, it is the output **file**.
- `--singlefile, -o`: Bundles all minified content into a single file. The default output file is `styles.min.css` if `--output`is not used.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Minifies all files of the current directory. Output in the same directory
bob minify

# Minifies all files of the passed directory. Output in the current directory
bob minify styles

# Minifies all files into an output directory
bob minify styles -o dist

# Minifies multiple files from different directories into a single file
bob minify styles dir1/style1.css dir2/style2.css --output site.min.css --singlefile
```

**Input and output:**

```css

/* INPUT */
body {
  user-drag: none;
  /*

  first comment

  */
  user-select: none;
  /*
  -moz-user-select: none;
  -webkit-user-drag: none;

```

### üå≥ Tree Command

Display a tree structure of the specified directory with customizable depth and formatting.

```bash
